# Gaps

If you need to have gaps between any blocks, you can use global `nb-with-SIDE-SIZE-gap` classes.

## Sides

Sides are `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left`, each such class would add the margin of the given `SIZE` at the corresponding side:

    'class': ['nb-with-SIZE-top-gap']

    'class': ['nb-with-SIZE-right-gap']

    'class': ['nb-with-SIZE-bottom-gap']

    'class': ['nb-with-SIZE-left-gap']

## Sizes

There are a few of possible preset sizes for gaps: `xs`, `s`, `m` and `l`. Each side have a modifier for each size, creating classes like `nb-gap_top_xs` etc.

    'class': ['nb-with-xs-SIDE-gap']

    'class': ['nb-with-s-SIDE-gap']

    'class': ['nb-with-m-SIDE-gap']

    'class': ['nb-with-l-SIDE-gap']
